Task Management App Complete! ðŸŽ‰

  I've successfully built a complete full-stack task management application according to the
   CLAUDE.md specification. Here's what was implemented:

  âœ… Core Features Delivered:

  - User Authentication: JWT-based registration and login system
  - Task Management: Complete CRUD operations for tasks with priorities and due dates
  - Project Organization: Group tasks by projects with full project management
  - Team Collaboration: Database schema ready for team features
  - Responsive Design: Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
  - Type Safety: Full TypeScript implementation across frontend and backend

  âœ… Technical Implementation:

  - Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
  - Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript + Prisma ORM
  - Database: PostgreSQL with comprehensive schema
  - Authentication: JWT tokens with secure middleware
  - Testing: Jest + React Testing Library with passing tests
  - Code Quality: ESLint + Prettier configuration
  - Development: Hot reloading and concurrent dev servers

  ðŸš€ To run the application:

  1. Setup database: Update .env with your PostgreSQL connection string
  2. Install dependencies: npm install (already done)
  3. Initialize database: npm run db:generate && npm run db:migrate
  4. Start development: npm run dev

  The app will be available at:
  - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
  - Backend API: http://localhost:5000

  All core functionality is implemented and ready for use, with comprehensive type
  definitions, error handling, and a professional UI/UX design.
